# About Me

Greetings! My name is Ruisheng Zhang, currently finishing my second year as a master in _Design_ from the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.seu.edu.cn/main.htm) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). **<font color=red>I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall.</font>** Currently, I am a member of the Advanced Human-Computer Interaction Lab in the Industrial Design Department, under the supervision of [Associate Professor Xiaozhou Zhou](https://me.seu.edu.cn/zxz1/list.htm). From 2018 to 2022, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in _Mechanical Engineering_ from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Southeast University.

## Research Interests
I am really passionate about developing advanced algorithms and methods to solve real-world problems, because it is incredibly rewarding to utilize noval technology to improve and enhance humans' lives. My research interests focus on **HCI research about pervasive computing and VR/AR**, especially in:
- **developing interactive devices for XR environments**
- **designing multi-modal user interfaces**
- **enhancing HCI user experiences with data-driven deep learning methods**. 

Additionally, I am also interested in **improving text input for XR scenarios**.

## Academic Skills
Currently, I possess proficient skills in **developing VR and AR applications using the Unity engine and C# programming language**. Additionally, I am adept at **developing neural networks using the Pytorch deep learning framework and Python**. Moreover, I have knowledge of fundamental psychological experimental design methods, data analysis techniques such as SPSS, visualization techniques such as Matplotlib. Furthermore, as a master in design, I have a grasp of basic collaborative design processes with Figma. The following outlines my specific skills:
- **Programming:** C#, Python, C++, Lua
- **Languages:** Chinese, English
- **Software:** Unity, Figma, Blender, Soildworks, SPSS, E-Prime
- **Tools:** Machine Learning & Data Process (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy), XR Development (Oculus Intergration, SteamVR, MRTK)

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
